What happened since version 1.60?

After a considerable time, in which I did nothing on RexxAutoStart, I am 
back now. Unfortunately, in the meantime, Chuck migrated RexxAutoStart to 
GPF/REXX, a development tool, I don't have (and don't intend to get).

In late October 2000 I restarted the work with VX-REXX from scratch. I did not
complete it, however... Until now. Originally, this version 1.8.0 was based on
the 1.60 codebase. I merged in the changes, Chuck made in 1.61 and 1.62, and 
ported some internal features of his 2.00.

So today, RexxAutoStart has two separate sources, Chuck's and mine. My 
intention is to integrate Chuck's advanced features (especially the LAN startup
folder) into my source. In addition, my version 1.8.0 has some features, 
Chuck's 2.00 currently has not.

The main differences are:

- It is based on the 1.6x codebase, all remaining switches and options are compatible.
- It still supports RXAUTOST environment variable and commandline parameters.
- It can be opened from anywhere, as long RXAUTOST.EXE is in the PATH 
  (1.6x and Chuck's 2.00 need the complete path in the execution line)
- It runs on OS/2 Warp 3, 4 and 4.5
- It has its own RXAUTOST.INI, which is 100% compatible to Chucks' INI.
- It does *not* support Chuck's LAN startup folder by now.
  It will in the next release
- It has the following features Chuck's 2.00 currently has not 
  (which I consider important for usability)
   - a progress bar
   - a Quit now! button to interrupt and leave startup processing immediately
- For those, who like to have bells and whistles (like me), version 1.8.0 
  supports the following features:
   - 3 cool sound events, configurable with the OS/2 sound object
   - configurable position and background colors
   - animated icon
